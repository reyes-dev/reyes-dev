### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jarrod, and this profile is for displaying my work as a programmer. You can find all of my personal projects here!

What I'm up to:
- Participating in Hacktoberfest and open source projects
- Building a dream journal web app with Ruby on Rails and React.
- Learning NeoVIM and vim motions. 

When I'm not programming, I like to :pencil2: sketch stuff in my sketchbook, :books: read books and :video_game: play indie video games
