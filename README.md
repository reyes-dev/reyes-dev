### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jarrod, and this profile is for displaying my work as a programmer. You can find all of my personal projects here!

What I'm up to:
- I'm currently obsessed with learning NeoVIM and vim motions. 
- Planning a big project with Ruby on Rails, Tailwind and React in mind
- Studying DS&A a little every day! Check my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/jarrodreyes98/) out.

When I'm not programming, I like to :pencil2: sketch stuff in my sketchbook, :books: read books and :video_game: play indie video games
